# SchoolPortfolio for Lance Cain
A Portfolio created while I am attending SNHU for software development

# Summarize the client and their needs
     I assisted in converting design requirements into functional code based on the requirements of the hypothetical client.  The client requested a solution to migrating a pre-existing game to a system and architecture that would allow for cross platform clients as well as efficient and cost effective server side solution.

# My proficiency in this endeavor
     As an author of the software design document it was my role to research and make determinations for the best architecture and operating platform solutions that would satisfy the clients requirements and achieve both a functional solution that is both efficient and accurate to their needs.

# Design Flow
     Working with a design document allows for higher level decisions to be made with only the relevant information which reduces information overload and mistakes.  Having a reference for the clients needs and proposed solutions helps to keep myself and other team members on track and in scope.

# Self-Critique
     Java being a less familiar language means that my practices and methods are more based on functionality than efficiency and security as they should be.  I would likely choose someone more qualified to lead the development life cycle of this product if the choice was made to use Java as the primary development language for this project.

# Client Need Satisfaction
     By determining the specific requirements in a way that we can verify with testing or simulation means that we can test our product to determine if it satisfies the requirements given to us by our clients.  This also helps with finding bugs or errors in the design or the code of the application prior to production environment deployment.

# Approach to ambiguity
     Software design has been a part of my thought process for over 20 years because I grew up watching applications go from basic if/else statements in loops, to full blown inheritance trees and cross language interactions.  Knowing how to design software is likely made easier by the examples of software I have seen all these years along with an education into the hardware that runs the software we develop.  Understanding that efficiency can be as simple as using ValueTask instead of the Task type in C# when the situation would be fully satisfied by the ValueTask reducing compute time and resource waste.  Having computers with far more limitations than we have today has instilled an appreciation for code that only uses resources necessary and does so with security as a requirement instead of an afterthought.
