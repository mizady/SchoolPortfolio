# How do you write programs that are maintainable?

Writing based on common practices such as using concepts like DRY, KISS, YAHNI, and SOLID principles, help to keep the code architecture as well as my own coding practices maintainable and readable.  Proper documentation of code and what functions do is also vital for code maintainability.  Keeping to these principles solve for many possible errors and vulnerabilities that would either be discovered the hard way through instability and/or other issues such as security incidences.  Using the repository pattern such as this crud module does, is used any many languages for web apis to give a place to hold logic needed for interfacing with the database in a useful and secure fashion that maintains stability, resiliency , and maintainability.


# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?

Anytime I have a challenge or a set of requirements that require determinations on how to get from A to B while meeting all security and business requirements, I often scratch up a rough system to ensure that I am aware of the needed steps to properly solve a problem.  While I scratch up a solution I can find further questions that are needed to further clarify software requirements and increase the quality of the code from the perspective of the end-user or client.  When I run into things I do not understand or need a solution that I cannot bridge the gap, I use resources like stack overflow and other resources for developers to learn new patterns and concepts and in some cases code reviews of previous software that solved similar problems.


# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?

Computer scientists understand computers and how they work to a degree necessary to create reliable and useful systems of hardware and software to solve business problems and achieve information for what is often meant to enrich the lives of humanity and explore the cosmos.  The work done on web apis such as this one, demonstrate how some time spent by a software developer can increase the efficiency and costs associated with rescue programs that need to find animal resources to fulfill their goals of saving human lives.
