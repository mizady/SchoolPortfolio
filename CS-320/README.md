## CS-320 Software Test Automation & quality assurance



# Proper testing comprehension

Testing code on all levels from unit testing to integration and user testing are paramount to creating a functionally stable and secure piece of software.  Comprehensively approaching testing by accounting for all feasibly possible ways for inputs and asserting proper outputs is vital to good quality code.

# Interpreting user needs

When Interpreting user needs it is good practice to ask questions and verify that your understanding of the users needs is correct.  Then an evaluation of capabilities of the software to determine if requirements can be met securely is also necessary.  Proper testing is used to verify that user needs are met at all levels in the software development process.

# Software development approach

Like any other challenge or obstacle when attempting to solve a problem, I take an iterative and comprehensive approach.  Determine the problem, determine possible options to solve problem, develop solution, test, then if tests are passing, implement and test more.
